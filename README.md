# Jekyll Theme

Left is a clean, minimalist and responsive layout for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

This is designed to be an easy layout to modify for your own blog. It was
extracted from [wp-vjousse](wp-vjousse).

## Installation

- Install Jekyll: `gem install jekyll`
- Fork this repository
- Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/K-Phoen/jekyll-theme`
- Run the jekyll server: `jekyll --server`

You should have a server up and running locally at <http://localhost:4000>.

## Deployment

You should deploy with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com)- it's just
easier.

All you should have to do is rename your repository on GitHub to be
`username.github.com`. Since everything is on the `gh-pages` branch, you
should be able to see your new site at <http://username.github.com>.
